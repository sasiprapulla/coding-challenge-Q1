*** QUESTION 1 ***

A robotic arm places boxes in 5 columns (A, B, C, D, E) each with height 10 boxes. The default position for the arm is before column A. The command F makes the arm move forward along the rows. The command D causes the load to be dropped. The load must be a string value that is required to be surrounded by {} following a D command. The command R causes the arm to go back to default position.

Dropping the load on a full column or the default position leads to nothing happening. Once a load is successfully dropped the arm moves forward one position except when in the last column where nothing happens. 
The arm cannot move ahead of the last column and will stay there if it receives a forward command.

Any other command is ignored and the robot stays in its current position. The commands are case sensitive.

Using the package structure provided, implement the public Map<String, List<String>> simulateArm(final String input) method in the Robot class.

The simulateArm method should accept the commands as a string and returns the state of the columns as a Map<String, List<String>>.

E.g.

Robot robot = new Robot();
Map<String, List<String>> output = robot.simulateArm("FD{foo}FFD{bar}RFFD{Foo}RFFD{World}D{}DA{hello}‚Äù);
System.out.println(output.toString()) // prints {A=[foo], B=[Foo, World], C=[], D=[bar, hello], E=[]} to the console

Your free to add to the files, classes, pom, dependencies, etc, as you require. 

Implement your test cases in the RobotTest class. Your free to use any testing framework(s) of your choice.

Please include instructions on how to run your unit tests.

SOLUTION

The solution is implemented in Java and maven.
Test cases are implemented using JUnit.
To build the application : mvn intall
To run the testcases : mvn test.
